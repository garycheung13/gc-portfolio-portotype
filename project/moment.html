                        <p>
                            Moment is a UX research and design project that explores the use of data
                            collection and analysis to help students manage their school-related
                            stress. I worked together with three other designers to create an app
                            for wearables that provides in-the-moment stress support. Our design
                            focused on creating a good data collection plan to encourage students
                            to improve their stress habits.
                        </p>
                        <p>This app was the result of a semester-long UX research and design project for my graduate-level class on personal informatics design.</p>

                        <p>
                            Most students will experience some degree of academic stress, the pressure to
                            perform well in school, during their time in college. In 2017, 28% of students
                            who sought counseling on college campuses were concerned about their performance
                            in school.* While every student has their own stress coping strategy, not all
                            approaches are equal. Some coping habits, such as overeating, have long-term
                            negative consequences on a student’s health.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As students who dealt with academic stress before, the topic was of great
                            interest to our team. We were interested in applying our design skills to
                            create a data-oriented solution to help students better manage their stress.
                        </p>

                            We wanted to know:

                                How could we use personal data collection and analysis to
                                design a tech-based intervention for academic stress?

                        <p>
                            To gather the right information for making a stress management app,
                            we focused our research on answering two key questions:

                        <p>
                            To brainstorm ideas for our app, our team reviewed the design of
                            several emotional support products. We took note on what form the
                            product took, what data was collected, and the type of intervention
                            offered.

                            From this analysis, we saw the importance of monitoring the user’s
                            condition, done through self-reporting or behavior monitoring by the
                            app. Several apps encourage users to share their feelings with another
                            person. However, Biostrap only offered tools for self-assessment.

                            experience with academic stress, we didn’t want to assume that other

                                stress caused fatigue and inability to focus.

                                Some de-stressing habits were counterproductive for schoolwork,
                                such as staying up late and becoming fatigued.

                                The biggest stress management improvements came from lifestyle
                                changes. Some examples cited include getting regular exercise
                                and improving their diet.

                        <p>
                            Moment is an app for wearables that helps students manage stress,
                            improve habits, and track their progress. The app detects when the
                            user is stressed with a heart rate sensor and provides guided coping
                            activities. With the app's data tracking, users can view graphs to get
                            feedback on their stress management process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When Moment detects a user’s increased heart rate, it suggests a guided relaxation
                            activity to help calm the user.

                            Moment guides the user through activities it suggests, providing
                            users directions to try something new.

                        <p>
                            Users are in control with Moment. App notifications can be delayed or
                            dismissed to reduce interruptions. This also lets Moment correct
                            false-positives.

                            Visible feedback is key to changing behavior. Through the wearable and
                            the mobile app, users can view their stress and heart rate data to see the
                            effectiveness of their de-stressing methods.

                            During our team’s ideation meeting, we brainstormed design

                                It required minimal input from the user and collected unbiased
                                data. However, heart rate was not accurate enough alone since heart
                                rate increases could stem from non-stress events such as exercise.

                                    To deal with data invalidity, Moment asks the user, "How are you
                                    feeling?" when it detects an increased heart rate. If the user
                                    tells Moment that they feel fine, the app marks the spike as a
                                    false positive and stops offering activity suggestions.

                        <p>
                            We designed Moment's workflow to encourage users to improve their de-stressing
                            habits. To accomplish this, our design strategy for the workflow used principles
                            from The Rider and the Elephant, a framework for behavior change from Chip & Dan
                            Heath's book Switch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Rider-Elephant framework uses a metaphor about a rider(rational
                            brain) trying to direct an elephant(emotional brain) down a path.
                            When the two sides disagree, the elephant will always overpower
                            the rider. They can only reach their goal when they work together.
                            In other words, a good behavior change plan needs to consider both
                            the rational and emotional parts of the brain.
                        </p>
                        <p>Heath & Heath recommend a three-part strategy for cooperation:</p>

                        <p>Directing the rider means making the steps to the behavior change goal clear. We do this in Moment in two ways:</p>
                        <ul class="case-shortlist">
                            <li>Recommend users specific activities. Each activity includes a description of how it helps with stress. Giving clear recommendations makes it easier for a user to move in the right direction.</li>
                            <li>Provide visible feedback through time graphs of the user's heart rate and stress rating data. By checking the trend direction, users can check if they are making progress. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These two features work in tandem to point the user in a specific direction and provide feedback on their progress.</p>
                        <img src="../images/moment/direct-the-rider.png" alt="">

                        <h4 class="case-subsection__header">Motivating the elephant: Appeal to emotion</h4>
                        <p>
                            Any plan for changing behavior needs a way to engage users emotionally. One way to do that is by
                            breaking down the change into smaller steps. Our app does this by providing step-by-step instructions
                            for each activity the app suggests. For example, when the app suggests meditation to the user,
                            it also teaches the user how to breathe for meditation. By doing this, we can ease the user into a
                            new de-stressing activity, making it less intimidating.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Shaping the path means making change easier by tweaking the user's environment. To do this in
                            Moment, we consider how students tended to repeat the same stress habits. Our solution was
                            to have Moment send an alert inviting the user to try one of the app's exercises when it
                            detects stress. This alert acts as a trigger, helping the user develop new stress habits
                            that include Moment's activities.

                            For the wearable portion of Moment, we experimented with physical prototyping for the
                            stress input UX using an Arduino. The prototype consisted of a LED ring and a knob
                            controlling the number of lights lit. We used Ubidots, a platform for IoT devices,
                            to display output.

                                    Keeping our user interviewees comfortable was vital to successful user interviews
                                    in this project. We needed to ask about their personal experiences with stress
                                    in college. To prepare, I carefully worded and rehearsed each stress question in the
                                    interview script. As a result, I was about to get my interviewee to share details about
                                    his stress that contributed to our team's findings.

                                    Breaking down design problems into smaller, actionable chunks can make them easier to manage. In
                                    this project, we needed to design a way to change users' stress habits, which I found hard. To make
                                    the problem more approachable, I break down the problem into distinct parts using the Rider and the
                                    Elephant framework. Doing this helped me organize my design ideas and make better decisions.
