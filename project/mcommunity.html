                        <p>
                            MCommunity is a directory and group management tool created by the University of Michigan's
                            IT department (ITS). Members of the school use it to look up people, create mailing groups,
                            and manage access to web resources. As MCommunity was getting old and hard to use, ITS began
                            work on a new version of the platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2017, ITS released a beta version of MCommunity. I was a member of a UX research team
                            that worked on an in-depth evaluation of the beta to advise ITS on new features and usability
                            improvements.

                        <p>
                            MCommunity, U-M’s contact directory and group management app, was getting old -- the UI
                            looked dated and hard to navigate. Members of the university started using other apps to
                            manage their groups. In 2017, ITS released a new beta version of its platform with a UI/UX
                            overhaul. They asked our team of five UX researchers to evaluate the usability of the beta
                            to recommend new features and changes:

                            As a research team, our first task was mapping the workflow of the website’s main features.
                            We did this to familiarize ourselves with the site and note potential UX problems.

                        <p>
                            We interviewed five members of the school to learn about how they used
                            MCommunity in their school and work activities. In each interview, we asked the
                            interviewee to share a story about using MCommunity and talk about their experiences
                            with the platform. Our interviewees included: one professor, one IT staff member, one student org leader, and two students.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-5">From our interviews, we learned several important points about our users use MCommunity:</p>
                        <ul class="row case-collist">
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Mailing list convenience</span>
                                MCommunity's group mailing lists were the most used feature by our interviewees. The platform's mailing lists were convenient because they got caught by spam filters.
                            </li>
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Out of date information</span>
                                Users can't rely on the contact information in profiles because it is often out of date.
                            </li>
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Get me off this mailing list</span>
                                Users found it hard to figure out to leave an MCommunity mailing list that they were added to by someone.
                            </li>
                            <li class="col-md-6">

                                IT wanted to use user analytics in the beta to inform development, but none of the users we interviewed even knew about the beta.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-5">Based on what we found, we recommended ITS make the following changes: </p>

                                Some interviewees were not sure what MCommunity is for exactly. We recommended ITS
                                emphasize the convenience of using the platform's mailing lists to attach their target users.
                            </li>
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Remind users to update their profile</span>
                                Prompt users to update their MCommunity profile once a year. A reminder will encourage more
                                users to keep contact information up to date.
                            </li>

                                MCommunity users did not like receiving emails from mailing lists they did not choose to join.
                                To reduce spam, ask the user before putting them in someone else’s mailing list.

                                IT should add a button to the homepage encouraging members to try the beta so they can get more user data for their analytics.

                            We compared MCommunity to its competitors to analyze the strengths and
                            weaknesses of its main features. The features we looked for each
                            product were:

                        </figure>
                        <p>After looking at all of the products, we made two key findings:</p>
                        <ul class="row case-collist">
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Personal information checks</span>
                                Although MCommunity includes a person lookup tool, it does not verify users' contact
                                information. In contrast, some MCommunity competitors will periodically remind their users
                                to keep their personal information up to date.
                            </li>
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Tricky Searches</span>
                                Unlike many of its competitors, MCommunity's search feature does not include autofill or autocomplete. As a result, users need to enter search terms accurately to get good results.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Based on what we saw in competing products, we made the following recommendations:</p>
                        <ul class="row case-collist">
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Add autocomplete to search</span>
                                We suggested that ITS add autocomplete to the search feature to shorten search time and rely less than perfect spelling.
                            </li>
                            <li class="col-md-6">
                                <span class="case-collist__heading">Periodic Verification</span>
                                At the start of each school semester, MCommunity should ask users to review their profiles to
                                encourage users to update their information. The platform is more reliable as a directory when
                                users' contact information is up to date.

                        <p>
                            We conducted a heuristic evaluation to look for usability defects in the MCommunity beta.
                            We looked at the entire platform, but focused on the group management since users valued it most.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our evaluation process went as follows:</p>

                            <li>We created a checklist of criteria based on Neilsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.</li>

                        <p>From our evaluation, we discovered three key issues:</p>
                        <ul class="case-shortlist">
                            <li>
                                <span class="font-weight-bold">Documentation is hard to find:</span>
                                Everyone evaluating the platform found it hard to find help on the site when they got stuck on a task.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="font-weight-bold">No Error Prevention:</span>
                                MCommunity does not warn the user if they leave a page with unsaved changes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="font-weight-bold">User roles in groups are unclear:</span>
                                There are three user roles for mailing group members -- Admin, Moderator, Member. Each has a
                                different set of permissions. This difference is not made clear by the platform.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To fix these problems we recommended:</p>

                            Our team finished our study with a usability test focusing on its group management features.
                            We conducted this test to identify UX problems in the user workflow, especially with group
                            management tasks. Each team member ran a test following the same script which asked users to
                            complete five tasks:
                        </p>

                                <h4 class="bullet-head">Pushed out of sight</h4>
                                Aftering new group members, most test-takers forgot to save their changes before leaving the
                                edit page. This mistake was common because adding a new member pushed the save button off-screen.
                                As a result, many test-takers left the page and lost their work without knowing that
                                there was a save button.
                            </li>

                                MCommunity group admins can add a group name as an alias for their school email account, but it
                                is hard to do. Only one person did it successfully. This task frustrated our test-takers, as not
                                only was the task difficult, most could not find the documentation page to get help.
                            </li>

                                <h4 class="bullet-head">Group name covered during deletion</h4>
                                Before users can delete a group, they must enter the group name into a pop-up to confirm

                                causing our test-takers to close and reopen the pop-up several times to check their spelling.

                                We reiterated our recommendation to add a warning when the user leaves a page with unsaved changes.
                                Losing work due to a missed step was a problem in both our heuristic evaluation and our usability
                                test.

                                Add a documentation link to MCommunity’s navigation bar to increase the visibility of help.
                                This addition makes it clear to the user how they can get guidance for hard tasks such as email aliasing.

                                To avoid the back and forth clicks when deleting a group, ITS should include the group name in
                                the pop-up. That way, students can check their spelling with less repetition and lower the chances of a typo.

                                Throughout the research process, we shared our research findings with our client. Getting feedback
                                from their team helped us understand their product goals, allowing us to focus our research on the
                                most impactful areas.

                                Sometimes, research does not go as planned. When it happens, be ready to adapt. When my usability
                                test participant couldn’t attend in-person, I tweaked the testing procedure to run the test
                                remotely. Although not ideal, this allowed me to save the situation and still get insights.
