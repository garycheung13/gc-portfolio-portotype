              <p>
                EMX Systems is a healthcare IT company developing a web-based
                app to make patient record exchange easier for healthcare
                providers. Their service combines patient records from multiple
                electronic medical record (EMR) systems and gives providers
                instant access through an online portal. With EMX’s software,
                providers would no longer need to wait for records to arrive by
                mail or fax, leading to more efficient patient care. I was part
                of a major project to completely redesign EMX System’s web
                portal with new features to improve the provider experience.

              <p>
                Patients often see multiple providers during treatment, such as
                when they need a specialist, move, or travel. When they do, the
                new provider needs to review the previous providers’ records.
                Since EMR systems from different vendors are not
                cross-compatible, the patient records need to be physically
                obtained -- through fax, snail mail, or bought in by the
                patient.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/emx/emx-chart.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                EMX Systems offers an alternative: a service that pulls patient
                records from multiple EMRs so they can be shared, combined, and
                viewed from a single location -- the EMX web portal.

              <p>
                Without any knowledge about healthcare delivery, our team’s
                first steps in this project were learning electronic record
                systems, patient record exchange, and patient encounters.
              </p>
              <h3 class="case-subhead" id="emx-interviews">User Interviews</h3>
              <p>
                We interviewed nine healthcare providers to learn about their
                experiences with EMRs and record exchange. Our findings showed
                that providers had similar concerns and experiences with EMR
                systems and patient record exchange.

                  <h4>Too much time on the computer</h4>
                  Providers felt that it took too long to find a specific record in their

                        In contrast to the unintuitive record systems providers usually use,
                        the new EMX portal offers a streamlined experience that gives providers
                        more time with their patients. Our redesign removes the bloat and focuses
                        on features that help providers find what they are looking for, as quickly
                        possible.

                    <h3 class="case-subhead">The Patient-centered Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        The patient record dashboard is the center of the new interface.
                        Records are organized by type with the most recent first, putting most
                        relevant records one click away.

                        The new interface lets providers change the types of records that appear
                        on their dashboard so they can prioritize what’s most relevant to their
                        practice.

                        user-tested features, and iterated based on the feedback received.

                    <h3 class="case-subhead" id="dashboard">Putting patients first: Designing the dashboard</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I learned about providers’ dislike for their current record systems,
                        I thought about how I could make EMX Systems the opposite &mdash; a system that
                        viders liked using. To tackle this question, I focused on what providers cared
                        about most: their patients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To focus on patients, I designed a dashboard that displayed a list of
                        patient records as the first screen after a provider selects a patient.
                        This list was ordered by most recent first. Since more recent records are
                        more often reviewed, this ordering increases the chance that the provider
                        finds the record they need right away.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I initially showed all record types in a single list, but changed my design
                        after the rest of the team reminded me that different kinds of records were
                        more relevant to different types of providers. To address this problem, I
                        split up different record types into different dashboard sections in my
                        next design iteration.

                    <h3 class="case-subhead" id="customize">Fitting EMX for All Provider Types</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our team took a design risk in the redesign allowing providers to customize
                        the record types that appeared on their dashboard. This feature would add
                        complexity, which providers viewed as a distraction from patient care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After debating the pros and cons, we decided on adding record type
                        personalization with an onboarding process. The time saved by having the
                        most relevant record types upfront would be worth the extra complexity.
                        We included the customization in the onboarding process so that the app
                        could guide providers through the setup and not require them to worry
                        about it later.

                    <h3 class="case-subhead" id="imaging">Presenting Medical Imaging Records</h3>
                    <p>
                        Providers we surveyed cited medical images as one of their most requested
                        record types. As such, I was particularly interested in figuring out the
                        best way to present them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My initial strategy for imaging was to present them like any other type of
                        record &mdash; click and view the document.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../images/emx/lofi-images-pair.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        But after testing my design, I discovered a flaw in my approach. Medical
                        images are not only used individually. Providers also compared images of
                        the same patient to check their progress!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In response to this discovery, I added a compare feature to imaging records
                        that lets users select multiple images and view them side by side.

                    <h3 class="case-subhead" id="filters">Cutting down on typing: Search filters</h3>
                    <p>
                        From our research, we knew that our users preferred searching to find
                        specific records, but did not like how precise they needed to be for
                        most record systems.  One interviewee noted about his EMR’s search,
                        “You cannot find anything if you type in spine clinic instead of
                        clinic spine.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Search filters are our team’s solution for easier searching. Instead of
                        memorizing and typing exact terms, EMX portal users can use broader keywords
                        and drill down with filters. Every record type that appears the dashboard includes
                        filter options, letting our users find records on the landing page, skipping the
                        typing altogether.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="case-subhead" id="save-for-later">A Sum of many parts: Save for later</h3>
                    <p>
                        During a user testing session, we saw users flipping between multiple
                        record categories to learn about the patient. When we asked what they
                        were doing, the users told us they needed to review several types of
                        records to get a good impression of the patient. We had not considered
                        this behavior up until this point. Our workflow required a lot of
                        repetition to get through multiple categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To reduce the repetition, we introduced a feature called Save for Later.
                        This feature allows users to bookmark records and review them from a
                        single page later. Bookmarking can be done with one click next to the
                        document and easily accessed through the “saved for later” shortcut on
                        the bottom right of the dashboard.

                    <h4 class="case-subhead__minor">Cutting Back for Limitations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our initial design for lab result records showed numbers from the lab right
                        in the dashboard to save a step. But after review with EMX’s developer,
                        we got feedback that it was unrealistic. Lab results are often scanned into
                        record systems as images and contain too many different values -- our
                        original idea was unfeasible.  To make our design more feasible, we
                        changed the lab report display to show a link to the report instead.

                    <h4 class="case-subhead__minor">Patient Demographics Location</h4>
                    <p>
                        In our early prototypes, patient demographics were put on the main
                        dashboard because we believed that this was important information for
                        a provider. However, after user testing, this assumption did not hold up.
                        While providers did want to see the patient’s demographics, they only
                        reviewed it extensively the first time they met the patient. Afterward,
                        it was only referred to as needed. With that in mind, I moved patient
                        demographics to a different part of the page. This choice decluttered
                        the interface and gave more room for useful patient information.

                        While working on this project, I maintained a set of shared UI design
                        guidelines for the UI  and updated them as the prototype evolved. Our UI
                        design focused on readability and uncluttered components to compliment our
                        flow UX. We knew that providers disliked when clutter distracting them from
                        patient care, so focused on creating a clean, unified interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While prototyping, our team referred to the design library to keep UI
                        elements consistent when more than one designer worked on a feature. We
                        also turned the library into a set of guidelines for our client's
                        developers to help them build our design.

                                Designers often make assumptions about the product and the users. Some of those assumptions
                                may be wrong, so it is vital to get user feedback to check that the features align
                                with the user's goals. In this project, user testing helped us catch mistakes
                                and inspired the creation of features like bookmarking with Save for Later.

                                understanding the healthcare context of this project. Our client,
                                a doctor, helped us answer any questions we had about the
                                healthcare process. Our team also shared prototypes for
                                feedback to ensure that we based our designs on a correct
                                understanding of the record exchange.
